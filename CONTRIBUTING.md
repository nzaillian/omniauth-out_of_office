# Contributing

For the best chance of having your changes merged, please:

* Fork the project.

* Make your feature addition or bug fix.

* Add tests for it. This is important so it is not accidentally broken in a future version.

* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (If you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself so it can be ignored when pulled).

* Send a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
